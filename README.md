## What it does
* introduces people from young ages up to skills and concepts needed for their desired careers through an interactive environment

## How we built it
* android studio and intellij 

## Challenges we ran into
* we are not familiar with the functions in android studio and Intellij, and it is our first project. 
* As we are all new to build an app, we faced the problem like running into the merge problem, having Gradle sync failed, etc.
* For me(Molly), I run into a problem that can't run the code written by my partner. I spent more than 3hours figured out it was caused by a useless file.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We learned how to design an app and be more familiar with everything in Intellij and android studio.
* We are excited about working together as a team to create something we’re happy about
