## Inspiration
* What inspired us for this idea was due to COVID-19, a lot of people have lost their jobs and are looking for new careers. We made a mobile application that provides different resources for people of all ages to use to help them have an idea of what their dream job would be like and different subjects they should focus on to get there. With FutureMe you can learn about different career paths you've dreamt of since you were a child or career path you found interest in last month as an adult. Our goal is to set people of all ages on the right path to a better you, a FutureYou.

## What it does
* FutureMe exposes people ranging in age from elementary school through adults to skills and concepts needed for their desired careers through an interactive environment.

## How we built it
* This mobile application was built using Java Intellij and Android Studio. Our prototype was built using AdobeXD.

## Challenges we ran into
* We faced many challenges as 75% of the team experienced their first hackathon this weekend. They included getting over the hurdle of figuring out GitHub, Java Intellij, and Android Studio. They also had a merge problem, Gradle sync failure, and a problem where the code would not run. It turned out that there was an unnecessary file accidentally left in the code causing the 3-hour search for what was happening. We also were unable to complete all of the mobile app but were able to complete the registration and homepage.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* We came together as a team to create something we’re happy about. In coming together, we learned how to use various programs to build our mobile app.

## What we learned
* We learned how to build a prototype in AdobeXD as well as how to build a mobile app using Java Intellij in Android Studio. Additionally, we became more familiar with GitHub specifically branching and reversing to a previous commit. But the most important thing we learned to do was work as a team. Having come together not knowing each other, we learned how to communicate to get the project done, which will further us in all our endeavors tech-related or not.

## What's next for FutureMe
* What’s next for FutureMe: We’re looking to expand our offerings in both careers as well as content for the careers. Also, we’re hoping to partner with companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, and CompTIA in offering discounts for students who complete the entire track of a career.
